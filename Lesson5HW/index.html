        <p id="p3">The term business often refers to an entity that operates for <u>commercial, industrial, or professional</u> reasons. The concept begins with an idea and a name, and extensive market research may be required to determine how feasible it is to turn the idea into a <i>business.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p id="p4">Businesses often require business plans before operations begin. A business plan is a formal document that outlines the company's goals and objectives and lists the strategies and plans to achieve these goals and objectives. Business plans are essential when you want to borrow capital to begin operations.</p>
